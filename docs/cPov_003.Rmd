## What does this indicator measure
Child poverty measures the percentage of children under age 18 who live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line in `r county_codes[row, 3]`. The federal poverty line was \$24,600 for a family of four in 2017. In `r year`, there were `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov)` (+/- `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_moe),0)`) children living in poverty in `r county_codes[row, 3]`, `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per),1)`% of all children. 


## Summary Table 
Children under age 18 who live in poverty in `r county_codes[row, 3]`

|             | Total Children | White Children | Black Children | Hispanic Children | Black-White Disparity | Hispanic-White Disparity | 
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Children in poverty** | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_A)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_B)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_C)` |  |  | 
| **Child population**    | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop)`  | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop_A)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop_B)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop_C)` |  |  |  
| **Child poverty rate**  | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per_A),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per_B),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per_C),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_B),1)` | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_C),1)` | 

**Data Source:** U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2013-2017, derived from Tables B01001, B01001H, B01001B, B01001I, B17001, B17001H, B17001B, and B17001I.

**Data Explanation:** Local child population and children in poverty estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2013-2017. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and thus subject to variability due to sampling error, margins of error are included in the tables below. 


### Disparity Ratio 
The disparity ratio is the percentage of black or Hispanic children living in poverty divided by the percentage of white children living in poverty. A disparity ratio of 1 reflects racial equality; values greater than one suggest higher rates of poverty among black or Hispanic children compared to white children while values less than 1 suggest lower rates of poverty among black or Hispanic children. 

* In `r county_codes[row, 3]`, black children experience poverty at notably greater rates than do white children. The disparity ratio shows that black children are `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_B),1)` times more likely to live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line. 
* In `r county_codes[row, 3]`, Hispanic children experience poverty at notably greater rates than do white children. The disparity ratio shows that Hispanic children are `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_C),1)` times more likely to live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line.


## Child Poverty by Census Tract

Within each map, clicking on a tract will show the estimated child population, the estimated children in poverty, and the estimated poverty rate. For child poverty, lighter colors show lower poverty rates and darker colors show higher poverty rates.

Among the tracts that stand out for high poverty rates among black children, only two contain sizeable estimated populations of black children. 

* Tract 106.01, situated within the Places 29 South Neighborhood, has an estimated population of 502 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 71%. 
* Tract 108, situated within the Places 29 South Neighborhood, has an estimated population of 234 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 43%.

Additional tracts with high estimated poverty rates are based in geographies with small estimated populations of black children. 

* Tract 104.02, an area that includes part of Pantops and the Village of Rivanna, has an estimated population of only 20 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 100%. 
* Tract 110, intersecting with the Western Neighborhoods and out towards Ivy, has an estimated population of 63 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 73%. 
* Tract 102.01, part of the Places 29 North Neighborhood, has an estimated population of 80 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 46%.

```

Among the tracts that stand out for high poverty rates among Hispanic children, only one contains a sizeable estimated population of Hispanic children. 

* Tract 113.02, within the Southern Neighborhood and home to the Southwood Mobile Home Park, has an estimated population of 778 Hispanic children and an estiamted poverty rate of 66%. 

Additional tracts with high estimated poverty rates are based in geographies with small estimated populations of Hispanic children. 

* Tract 108, just west of Places 29 South, and Tract 112.01, in the far western rural county, have estimated populations of only 2 and 41 Hispanic children, respectively, making the estimated poverty rates of 100% very uncertain.

* Tract 109.02, in the Western Neighborhood, and Tract 102.02, west of 29, have estimated populations of only 68 and 47 Hispanic children, and estimated poverty rates of 72%.

* Tract 109.01, situated in the Western Neighborhood, has an estimated population of only 8 Hispanic children, again making the estimated poverty rate of 50% very uncertain.

Child poverty among white children is noticeably less throughout Albemarle. Among the tracts with poverty rates estimates of more than 20%, two have notable estimated populations of white children. 

* Tract 113.02, within the Southern Neighborhood and home to the Southwood Mobile Home Park, has an estimated population of 233 white children and an estiamted poverty rate of 26%. 
* Tract 106.01, situated within the Places 29 South Neighborhood, has an estimated population of 738 white children and an estimated poverty rate of 23%. 

The remaining tract with moderately high estimated poverty rates is based in a geography with a small estimated populations of white children. 

* Tract 109.01, situated in the Western Neighborhood, has an estimated population of only 18 white children, making the estimated poverty rate of 33% very uncertain.


## Data Tables
The following tables show the population estimates and poverty rates for each census tract. The tables also provide the margains of error associated with each estimate. ACS data is based on a sample and so estimates contain a degree of uncertainty. Larger margins mean the estimate is less accurate. Typically the larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This means in cases where the population of interest is very small (very few children live in a census tract), estimates can be very unreliable. 

### Missing values
In the poverty rate table, NaN's exist when there is division by zero, that is, when the population of interest in that census tract is estimated to be zero. Poverty rate estimates of zero occur when the number of children estimated to be in poverty is zero.
