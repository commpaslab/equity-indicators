<p><strong>Data Source:</strong> U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2013-2017, Derived from tables B15002, C15002H, C15002I, and C15002B.</p>
<p><strong>Data Explanation:</strong> Local population and educational attainment estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2013-2017. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and thus subject to variability due to sampling error, margins of error are included in the tables below.</p>
<div id="disparity-ratio" class="section level3">
<h3>Disparity Ratio</h3>
<p>The disparity ratio is the percentage of black or hispanic adults (over 25) who have attained a Bachelors degree or higher divided by the percentage of white adults (over 25) who have attained a Bachelors degree or higher. A disparity ratio of 1 reflects racial equality; values <em>lower</em> than 1 suggest lower educational attainment rates among black or Hispanic adults (over 25) compared to whites. Ratios greater than 1 suggest higher educational attainment rates among black or Hispanic adults (over 25).</p>
<ul>
<li>In Charlottesville City, black residents have a notably lower rate of Bachelor degree attainment than do white residents. The disparity ratio shows that black residents are only 0.1 as likely to have a 4-year college degree.</li>
<li>In Charlottesville City, Hispanic residents have a lower rate of Bachelor degree attainment than do wite residents. The disparity ratio shows that Hispanic residents are only 0.6 times as likely to have a 4-year college degree.</li>

<h2>Bachelors Degree Attainment by Census Tract</h2>
<p>Within each map, clicking on a tract will show the estimated adult (over 25) population, the estimated number of adults with a Bachelors degree or higher, and the estimated degree attainment rate. For educational attainment, lighter colors show lower educational attainment rates and darker colors show higher educational attainment rates.</p>

<p>The percent of black residents with a 4-year college degree across all Census tracts in Charlottesville is below the rate for white residents in any tract. The tracts with the highest estimated rates hover around a 30% bachelor degree attainment rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tract 6, situated within the Jefferson Park Avenue neighborhood, has an estimated population of 204 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 32%.</li>
<li>Tract 9, the Locust Grove neighbhorhood, has an estimated population of 130 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 30%.</li>
<li>Tract 10, containing the North Downtown and Starr Hill neighbhorhoods, has an estimated population of 168 black addults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 29%</li>
</ul>
<p>Another three tracts have estimated rates of degree of attainment of less than 3%. Two of these contain the highest estimated number of black adult residents, but low values like these are necessarily estimated with greater uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tract 4.01, congruent with the Ridge Street neighborhood, has an estimated population of 949 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 2%%.</li>
<li>Tract 5.01, following the Fifeville neighborhood, has an estimated population of 1,331 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 2%%.</li>
<li>Tract 3.02, including the Martha Jefferson and Woolen Mills neighbhorhoods, has an estimated population of 306 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 2%.</li>

<p>While several tracts have very high estimates of degree attainment among the adult Hispanic population, all of the regions with estimated rates above 50% are based on very small estimated populations. They are, as a result, very uncertain estimates. The estimated degree attainment rates in the tracts with more substantial Hisapnic populations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tract 8, the neighborhoods of Greenbrier and The Meadows, with an estimated population of 515 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 23%.</li>
<li>Tract 4.01, congruent with the Ridge Street neighborhood, with an estimated poulation of 201 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 22%.</li>
<li>Tract 5.02, encompassingthe Fry’s Spring and Johnson Village neighborhoods, with an estimated populaiton of 159 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 42%.</li>

<p>For all but one Census tract in Charlottesville, the estimated degreee attainment rate is over 50% among white residents. The three hightest estimates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tract 7, combining the Lewis Mountain and Barracks Road neighborhoods with parts of Venable and Barracks/Rugby, with an estimated population of 2,190 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 81%.</li>
<li>Tract 6, situated within the Jefferson Park Avenue neighborhood, with an estimated 760 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 73%.</li>
<li>Tract 10, containing the North Downtown and Starr Hill neighbhorhoods, with an estimaed 2,235 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 70%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one tract has an estimated degree attainment rate below 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tract 4.02, encompassing the Belmont neighborhood, with an estimated population of 3,210 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 45%.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Tables</h2>
<p>The following tables show the population estimates and Bachelors degree attainment rates for each census tract. The tables also provide the margains of error associated with each estimate. ACS data is based on a sample and so estimates contain a degree of uncertainty. Larger margins mean the estimate is less accurate. Typically the larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This means in cases where the population of interest is very small (very few adults (over 25) live in a census tract), estimates can be very unreliable.</p>
<div id="missing-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Missing values</h3>
<p>In the Bachelors degree attainment rate table, NaN’s exist when there is division by zero, that is, when the population of interest in that census tract is estimated to be zero. Bachelors degree attainment rate estimates of zero occur when the number of Bachelors degrees or higher earned in that census tract is zero.</p>
