# **Child Poverty in `r county_codes[row, 3]`**

<br>

### What does this indicator measure
Child poverty measures the percentage of children under age 18 who live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line in `r county_codes[row, 3]`. The federal poverty line was \$24,600 for a family of four in 2017. In `r year`, there were `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov)` (+/- `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_moe),0)`) children living in poverty in `r county_codes[row, 3]`, `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per),1)`% of all children. 


## Summary Table 
Children under age 18 who live in poverty in `r county_codes[row, 3]`

|             | Total Children | White Children | Black Children | Hispanic Children | Black-White Disparity | Hispanic-White Disparity | 
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Children in poverty** | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_A)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_B)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$cPov_C)` |  |  | 
| **Child population**    | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop)`  | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop_A)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop_B)` | `r last(equityTable_cPov$pop_C)` |  |  |  
| **Child poverty rate**  | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per_A),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per_B),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Per_C),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_B),1)` | `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_C),1)` | 

**Data Source:** U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2013-2017, derived from Tables B01001, B01001H, B01001B, B01001I, B17001, B17001H, B17001B, and B17001I.

**Data Explanation:** Local child population and children in poverty estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2013-2017. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and thus subject to variability due to sampling error, margins of error are included in the tables below. 


### Disparity Ratio 
The disparity ratio is the percentage of black or Hispanic children living in poverty divided by the percentage of white children living in poverty. A disparity ratio of 1 reflects racial equality; values greater than one suggest higher rates of poverty among black or Hispanic children compared to white children while values less than 1 suggest lower rates of poverty among black or Hispanic children. 

* In `r county_codes[row, 3]`, black children experience poverty at greater rates than do white children. The disparity ratio shows that black children are `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_B),1)` times more likely to live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line. 
* In `r county_codes[row, 3]`, Hispanic children experience poverty at greater rates than do white children. The disparity ratio shows that Hispanic children are `r round(last(equityTable_cPov$Ratio_C),1)` times more likely to live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line.



## Child Poverty by Census Tract

Within each map, clicking on a tract will show the estimated child population, the estimated children in poverty, and the estimated poverty rate. For child poverty, lighter colors show lower poverty rates and darker colors show higher poverty rates.

Four of the six Census tracts in Louisa have estimated poverty rates among black children of more than 20%; three of these estimates are based on fairly sizeable estimated populations of black children. 

* Tract 9505, in the southeast corner of the county, has an estimated population of 125 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 66%. 
* Tract 9503, in the western reginon of the county, has an estimated population of 129 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 41%.
* Tract 9502.01, containing the town of Louisa and surrounding area, has an estimated population of 175 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 30%

The final tract with a high estimated poverty rate is based in a tract with small estimated populations of black children. 

* Tract 9504, in the central southern region of the county, has an estimated population of 54 black children and an estimated poverty rate of 67%.

```

Two Census tracts have poverty rates among white children of over 20% with sizeable estimated population of white children. 

* Tract 9502.02, containing the Town of Mineral and surrounding region, has an estimated population of 680 white children and an estiamted poverty rate of 30%. 
* Tract 9505, in the southeast corner of the county, has an estimated population of 1,015 white children and an estimated poverty rate of 30%. 


## Data Tables
The following tables show the population estimates and poverty rates for each census tract. The tables also provide the margains of error associated with each estimate. ACS data is based on a sample and so estimates contain a degree of uncertainty. Larger margins mean the estimate is less accurate. Typically the larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This means in cases where the population of interest is very small (very few children live in a census tract), estimates can be very unreliable. 

### Missing values
In the poverty rate table, NaN's exist when there is division by zero, that is, when the population of interest in that census tract is estimated to be zero. Poverty rate estimates of zero occur when the number of children estimated to be in poverty is zero.
