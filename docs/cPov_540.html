<p><strong>Data Source:</strong> U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2013-2017, derived from Tables B01001, B01001H, B01001B, B01001I, B17001, B17001H, B17001B, and B17001I.</p>
<p><strong>Data Explanation:</strong> Local child population and children in poverty estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2013-2017. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and thus subject to variability due to sampling error, margins of error are included in the tables below.</p>
<div id="disparity-ratio" class="section level3">
<h3>Disparity Ratio</h3>
<p>The disparity ratio is the percentage of black or Hispanic children living in poverty divided by the percentage of white children living in poverty. A disparity ratio of 1 reflects racial equality; values greater than one suggest higher rates of poverty among black or Hispanic children compared to white children while values less than 1 suggest lower rates of poverty among black or Hispanic children.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Charlottesville City, black children experience poverty at notably greater rates than do white children. The disparity ratio shows that black children are 4 times more likely to live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line.</li>
<li>In Charlottesville City, Hispanic children experience poverty at somewhat greater rates than do white children. The disparity ratio shows that Hispanic children are 1.6 times more likely to live in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line.</li>
</ul>

<p>Child poverty among white children is less throughout Charlottesville. Three Census tracts have poverty rates over 20% with sizeable estimated population of white children.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tract 4.01, containing the Ridge Street neighborhood, has an estimated population of 192 white children and an estiamted poverty rate of 38%.</li>
<li>Tract 5.01, situated in the Fifeville neighborhood, has an estimated population of 172 white children and an estimated poverty rate of 26%.</li>
<li>Tract 4.02, covering the Belmont neighborhoo, has an estimated population of 387 white children and an estimated poverty rate of 21%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same three tracts have high rates of child poverty among black children. In tract 5.01, the rates among black and white children are quite similar.</p>

<h2>Data Tables</h2>
<p>The following tables show the population estimates and poverty rates for each census tract. The tables also provide the margains of error associated with each estimate. ACS data is based on a sample and so estimates contain a degree of uncertainty. Larger margins mean the estimate is less accurate. Typically the larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This means in cases where the population of interest is very small (very few children live in a census tract), estimates can be very unreliable.</p>
<div id="missing-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Missing values</h3>
<p>In the poverty rate table, NaN’s exist when there is division by zero, that is, when the population of interest in that census tract is estimated to be zero. Poverty rate estimates of zero occur when the number of children estimated to be in poverty is zero.</p>
