### What does this indicator measure
`r degree` Degree Attainment Population measures the percentage of `r county_codes[row, 3]` adults over age 25 with a `r degree` degree or higher (equivalency also counted). In `r year`, there were `r last(equityTable_ed$ed)` (+/- `r round(last(equityTable_ed$ed_moe),0)`) adults over age 25 with a `r degree` degree, `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per),1)`% of all adults over 25.

## Summary Table
Adults age 25 and over that have obtained a `r degree` degree or higher in `r county_codes[row, 3]`

|             | Total Adults | White Adults | Black Adults | Hispanic Adults | Black-White Disparity | Hispanic-White Disparity | 
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Adults with a `r degree` degree or higher** | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed_H)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed_B)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed_I)` |  |  | 
| **Adult population**    | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop)`  | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop_H)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop_B)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop_I)` |  |  |  
| **`r degree` Degree Attainment rate**  | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per_H),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per_B),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per_I),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_B),1)` | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_I),1)` | 

**Data Source:** U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2013-2017, Derived from tables B15002, C15002H, C15002I, and C15002B.

**Data Explanation:** Local population and educational attainment estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2013-2017. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and thus subject to variability due to sampling error, margins of error are included in the tables below.

### Disparity Ratio 
The disparity ratio is the percentage of black or hispanic adults (over 25) who have attained a `r degree` degree or higher divided by the percentage of white adults (over 25) who have attained a `r degree` degree or higher. A disparity ratio of 1 reflects racial equality; values *lower* than 1 suggest lower educational attainment rates among black or hispanic adults (over 25) compared to whites. Ratios greater than 1 suggest higher educational attainment rates among black or hispanic adults (over 25). 

* In `r county_codes[row, 3]`, black residents have a notably lower rate of Bachelor degree attainment than do white residents. The disparity ratio shows that black residents are only `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_B),1)` as likely to have a 4-year college degree. 
* In `r county_codes[row, 3]`, Hispanic residents have a lower rate of Bachelor degree attainment than do wite residents. The disparity ratio shows that Hispanic residents are only `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_I),1)` times as likely to have a 4-year college degree.

## `r degree` Degree Attainment by Census Tract

Within each map, clicking on a tract will show the estimated adult (over 25) population, the estimated number of adults with a `r degree` degree or higher,  and the estimated degree attainment rate. For educational attainment, lighter colors show lower educational attainment rates and darker colors show higher educational attainment rates.

## Data Tables
The following tables show the population estimates and `r degree` degree attainment rates for each census tract. The tables also provide the margains of error associated with each estimate. ACS data is based on a sample and so estimates contain a degree of uncertainty. Larger margins mean the estimate is less accurate. Typically the larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This means in cases where the population of interest is very small (very few adults (over 25) live in a census tract), estimates can be very unreliable. 

### Missing values
In the `r degree` degree attainment rate table, NaN's exist when there is division by zero, that is, when the population of interest in that census tract is estimated to be zero. `r degree` degree attainment rate estimates of zero occur when the number of `r degree` degrees or higher earned in that census tract is zero.
